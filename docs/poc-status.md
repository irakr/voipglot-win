## ðŸ”„ Integration Status

### Current State
All three core components have been individually tested and validated. Each component:
- Works with real hardware (microphones, speakers)
- Has automated build and setup scripts
- Includes comprehensive error handling
- Provides detailed logging and debugging
- Supports configuration management

### Next Steps
1. **Pipeline Integration**: Connect all three components into a single application
2. **Audio Buffering**: Implement efficient audio buffering between pipeline stages
3. **Virtual Microphone Output**: Integrate VB-CABLE for audio output
4. **Performance Optimization**: Minimize end-to-end latency
5. **GUI Development**: Create user interface for configuration and monitoring

## Build and Setup Automation

### Automated Scripts
Each PoC implementation includes automated build scripts:

#### VOSK STT (`tests/stt-vosk/build.ps1`)
```powershell
# Automated setup with model download
.\build.ps1 -SetupEnv -DownloadModel

# Custom VOSK path
.\build.ps1 -VoskPath "C:\vosk" -SetupEnv
```

#### CTranslate2 (`tests/translation-ct2/build.ps1`)
```powershell
# Full automated setup
.\build.ps1

# Verifies Python version, installs dependencies, downloads models
```

#### Coqui TTS (`tests/tts-coqui/build.ps1`)
```powershell
# Standard build
.\build.ps1

# Builds Rust project with Coqui TTS integration
```

### Environment Requirements
- **Windows**: Developer PowerShell environment
- **Python**: 3.8-3.12 (for CTranslate2)
- **CMake**: 3.28.3 (for CTranslate2)
- **Rust**: 2021 edition or later
- **VOSK**: Library and models (automated download)
- **Coqui TTS**: Python package (automated installation)

## Performance Characteristics

### VOSK STT
