# VOSK and TTS Fixes - Empty Text and Audio Quality Issues

## Issues Identified

### 1. **VOSK Empty Text on First Speech**
**Problem**: VOSK always returned empty text on the first speech attempt, but worked correctly on subsequent attempts.

**Root Cause**: VOSK recognizer needs a "warm-up" period to establish context and acoustic models. Without this warm-up, the first speech input results in empty text.

**Solution**: Added a `warm_up_recognizer()` method that processes 0.5 seconds of silence audio during initialization to establish VOSK context.

### 2. **High-Pitched Cartoon Voice**
**Problem**: TTS output sounded like a high-pitched cartoon voice despite using the fast_pitch model.

**Root Causes**:
- Sample rate mismatch: TTS outputs at 22.05kHz but audio system was at 48kHz
- Unnecessary audio transformations (pitch shifting, speed changes)
- Poor audio normalization causing artifacts
- Complex resampling algorithms

**Solutions**:
- Aligned all sample rates to 22.05kHz to eliminate resampling
- Removed unnecessary audio transformations (pitch shifting, speed changes)
- Improved audio normalization with gentle 90% max amplitude scaling
- Simplified audio processing pipeline to match PoC approach

## Technical Changes

### VOSK Fixes (`src/translation/stt.rs`)

1. **Added Warm-up Mechanism**:
   ```rust
   fn warm_up_recognizer(&mut self) -> Result<()> {
       // Process 0.5 seconds of silence to establish VOSK context
       let silence_samples = (self.sample_rate as f32 * 0.5) as usize;
       let silence_audio: Vec<i16> = vec![0; silence_samples];
       // Process silence through VOSK recognizer
   }
   ```

2. **Modified Initialization**:
   - Added warm-up call during `new()` method
   - Ensures VOSK is ready for first speech input

### TTS Fixes (`src/translation/tts.rs`)

1. **Simplified Synthesis Pipeline**:
   - Removed complex audio transformations
   - Used direct TTS output without pitch/speed modifications
   - Improved audio normalization with gentle scaling

2. **Better Audio Processing**:
   ```rust
   // Gentle normalization to prevent clipping
   let normalization_factor = 0.9 / max_sample;
   for sample in &mut samples {
       *sample *= normalization_factor;
   }
   ```

3. **Eliminated Resampling**:
   - Only resample if absolutely necessary (different sample rates)
   - Use native 22.05kHz throughout the pipeline

### Configuration Updates (`config.toml`)

1. **Unified Sample Rates**:
   - Audio: 22050Hz (was 48000Hz)
   - STT: 22050Hz (was 48000Hz)
   - TTS: 22050Hz (native)

2. **Optimized Settings**:
   - Increased silence threshold to 0.03 for better speech detection
   - Maintained mono audio for consistency

## Expected Results

### VOSK Improvements
- ✅ First speech attempt will now work correctly
- ✅ No more empty text on initial speech
- ✅ Consistent speech recognition from the start

### TTS Improvements
- ✅ Natural-sounding voice (no more cartoon-like quality)
- ✅ Better audio clarity and natural pitch
- ✅ Reduced processing overhead
- ✅ Faster synthesis times maintained

## Testing

To verify the fixes:

1. **VOSK Test**: Speak immediately after app start - should work on first attempt
2. **TTS Test**: Listen to synthesized speech - should sound natural, not high-pitched
3. **Performance Test**: Check that synthesis times remain fast (under 200ms)

## Notes

- The warm-up adds ~0.5 seconds to initialization time but prevents the empty text issue
- Sample rate alignment eliminates resampling artifacts that caused audio quality issues
- Simplified audio processing maintains performance while improving quality
- These changes follow the proven approach from the working PoC application
